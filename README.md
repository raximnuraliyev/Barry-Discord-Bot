# Barry Bot

Barry Bot is a fully AI-powered Discord bot with robust moderation, reminders, and MongoDB-backed persistent storage. All responses are generated by DeepSeek models via OpenRouter, and all data is stored in MongoDB (no JSON files).

## Features

- **AI-Only Responses**: Every reply is dynamically generated by DeepSeek (via OpenRouter). No canned or keyword-based responses.
- **Advanced Moderation**: Automatic spam detection with escalating actions (warn, timeout, ban), plus moderation commands for warnings, timeouts, and bans.
- **Reminders**: Users can set reminders for themselves or others.
- **MongoDB Storage**: All user data, reminders, moderation logs, and bot memory are stored in MongoDB. No local JSON files are used.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raximnuraliyev/Barry-Discord-Bot.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your `.env` file with your Discord bot token, MongoDB URI, and OpenRouter API key.
4. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Configuration

- **.env**: Required variables:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
  - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key

## Commands

- `/askbarry [question]`: Ask Barry anything. Barry will reply with an AI-generated answer.
- `/warn [user] [reason]`: Issue a warning to a user.
- `/timeout [user] [duration] [reason]`: Temporarily mute a user.
- `/serverstats`: Show server statistics.
- `/remind [user] [time] [reminder]`: Set a reminder for a user.

## Moderation & Spam Handling

Barry automatically detects spam and escalates actions:

1. **Warn**: First offense
2. **Timeout**: Second offense
3. **Ban**: Third offense

All moderation actions and spam strikes are tracked in MongoDB.

## Data Storage

Barry uses MongoDB for all persistent data:

- User data
- Reminders
- Moderation logs
- Barry's memory and server state

No local JSON files are used or required.

## Required JSON Files


Barry Bot uses several JSON files for data storage and configuration. Make sure these files exist in your project root (they can be empty or pre-filled as needed):

- `barry-ask-responses.json` — Custom Q&A responses
- `barry-personality.json` — Personality traits and dialogue
- `database.json` — User stats and moderation logs
- `inactive-users.json` — Inactivity tracking
- `reminder.json` — Stores user reminders and scheduling data


You can create these files manually or copy them from a template if provided. They are ignored by git for privacy and security.
